## Module Description ##
This module is used to learn and then apply air quality dispersion modeling using an R-based programming module, with the help of the package ‘openair’ and open-sourced air quality datasets of cities in Germany. 

## Folder Structure ##

For instructors and interested parties, the history of this repository (with detailed commits), can be found [here](https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/ENGS37_W22/commits/main/).

**On Repository Structure:**
* **Preliminary**: Contains all files pre-requisite to module development. ```difuse_scaffolding``` is provided by DIFUSE, and ```course_materials``` (including course syllabus, relevant assignments, etc.) are provided by course instructor.
* **Development**: Contains all files that developers deem necessary to be stored on GitHub. Given the uniqueness of each module and the abstraction that DIFUSE provides, the development team is allowed to use the platform they prefer (or as discussed with instructor)
* **Completed_Module**: DIFUSE is committed to increasing data science education, and shares its work publicly as an NSF-funded grant. In order for these modules to remain usable by course instructors, DIFUSE removes the solutions to module assignments in its public release. Thus, the public repository will have the ```solutions\``` folder removed.
* **Additional**: At the discretion of module developers, contains sample datasets and other materials. May include on-ramp tutorials for module platforms (e.g. MATLAB Onramp), or anecdotes of challenges in implementation (e.g. data sources that were inaccessible or difficult to acquire).
