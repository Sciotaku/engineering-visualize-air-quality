## Primary Objective

The primary objective for this module is to learn and then apply air quality dispersion modeling using an R-based programming module, with the help of the package ‘openair’ and open-sourced air quality datasets of cities in Germany. 

## Student Expectations

Give details of what students have as background.  Do we expect them to have certain skills? Does the course have prerequisites? etc.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:
1.	understand the basics of dispersion modeling
2.	obtain and clean data sets
3.	analyze those data sets
4.	communicate results to peers and target audience members.
